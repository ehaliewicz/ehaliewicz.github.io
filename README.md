## Language Immersion Time Tracker (2022-2023)

### I was dissatisfied with existing tools for time tracking, so I decided to make my own.  Can be used for any kind of time tracking, but specifically tuned for my language learning needs.

### The backend is powered by python, django and postgres.  For the frontend, I avoided typescript, using javascript, preact, and htm so no builds were required and page load times were kept minimal.  

### This project does just about everything I need now, and is no longer under active development, aside from rare bugfixes.
