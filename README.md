## Language Immersion Time Tracker (2022-2023)

### I was dissatisfied with existing tools for time tracking, so I decided to make my own.  Can be used for any kind of time tracking, but specifically tuned for my language learning needs.

### I avoided typescript and react, and used javascript, preact, and htm so no builds were required and page load times were kept minimal.  

### This project is "complete", and is no longer under active development, aside from rare bugfixes, as it does just about everything I need.

### [Source code](github.com/ehaliewicz/time-tracker).
